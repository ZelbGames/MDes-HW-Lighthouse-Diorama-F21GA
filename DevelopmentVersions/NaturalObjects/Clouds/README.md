NOTE: Do not follow rest of tutorial, it is based on a pre blender 4.0 version

1. Clouds are made using Metaballs that attach together to form large blobs (roughly in the shape of clouds)
2. Next convert the meta balls to a single mesh(CTRL + A, Visual geometry to mesh)
3. Add a Subdivide and then a decismate modifier (to keep the number of verticies down)
4. Finnaly create a basic toon shader and apply to the mesh

- Reminder to add cloud from ff somewhere in there
